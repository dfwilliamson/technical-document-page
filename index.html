        <h2>Constructed</h2>
      </header>
      <body>
        <p>The three most popular constructed formats in Magic: The Gathering are Standard, Modern, and Commander.</p>
        <h3>Standard</h3>
        <p>Standard is a rotating format that includes the most recent sets released by Wizards of the Coast.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>For 2 players (1v1)</li>
          <li>Players start at 20 life</li>
          <li>Minimum decksize of 60 cards</li>
          <li>Sideboard of 15 cards</li>
        </ul>
        <code>Decks in Standard can only consist of cards from the current Standard-legal sets, typically the last two years' worth of sets.</code>
        <p>The rotation of sets occurs regularly, usually with the release of a new expansion, causing older sets to rotate out of the format.</p>
        <h3>Modern</h3>
        <p>Modern is a non-rotating format that includes a larger card pool compared to Standard.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>For 2 players (1v1)</li>
          <li>Players start at 20 life</li>
          <li>Minimum decksize of 60 cards</li>
          <li>Sideboard of 15 cards</li>
        </ul>
        <code>Decks in Modern can include cards from Eighth Edition (2003) onward, excluding a specific ban list of cards deemed too powerful for the format. </code>
        <p>Modern provides a diverse and stable environment with a wide range of strategies and deck archetypes.</p>
        <h3>Commander (EDH - Elder Dragon Highlander)</h3>
        <p>Commander is a casual multiplayer format known for its social and political aspects.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>For 2+ players (free for all)</li>
          <li>Players start at 40 life</li>
          <li>Decks must contain 100 cards only (including the commander)</li>
          <li>No sideboard</li>
        </ul>
        <code>Singleton rule: Except for basic lands, each card in the deck must have a different name, adding diversity and uniqueness to each deck.</code>
        <p>The format encourages creativity and unique deck-building due to the singleton rule and the social nature of multiplayer games.</p>

    <section class="main-section" id="Limited">
      <header>
        <h2>Limited</h2>
      </header>
      <body>
        <p>Limited is a category of Magic: The Gathering gameplay where participants build their decks on the spot from a limited pool of cards, often through booster packs. The two most popular Limited formats are Draft and Sealed.</p>
        <h3>Draft</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>In a Draft, players sit in a circle and open booster packs one at a time.</li>
          <li>Each player selects a card from their pack and then passes the remaining cards to the next player.</li>
          <li>This process continues until all the cards are chosen, and players use the cards they selected to build their decks.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Players then build their decks with the following restrictions, then pair off to play 1 v 1 games.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Decks must have a minimum of 40 cards</li>
          <li>Your sideboard is every drafted card in your card pool</li>
          <li>Players start with 20 life</li>
        </ul>
        <code>Drafting requires strategic card selection, considering both the strength of the cards and the needs of the potential deck.</code>
        <h3>Sealed</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>In a Sealed event, each player receives a specific number of booster packs (typically six) and constructs a deck using only those cards.</li>
          <li>Players do not pass cards around; instead, they use the entirety of their sealed pool to build a 40-card minimum deck.</li>
          <li>Sealed is often more straightforward than Draft and is a good introduction to Limited play for newer players.</li>
          <li>It emphasizes deck-building skills and adapting to the cards you open.</li>
        </ul>
        <code>These formats are popular for various reasons, including the level playing field they create, the element of surprise, and the need for adaptability and strategic thinking during deck construction. </code>
        <p>Limited formats often showcase players' skills in evaluating card choices, building effective decks with limited resources, and adapting to unknown situations, making them a favorite among many Magic players.</p>
